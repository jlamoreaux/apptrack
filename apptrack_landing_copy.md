## Graphics Suggestions

**Current state:** Your site looks clean but could use more visual interest

**Recommended additions:**
1. **Hero mockup:** Screenshot of your dashboard with sample data
2. **Feature illustrations:** Simple icons for each feature (tracking, AI, interviews, networking)
3. **Progress visualization:** Show a sample Sankey chart in action
4. **Social proof photos:** Stock photos of diverse professionals (or real user photos if available)
5. **Before/after comparison:** Messy spreadsheet vs. clean AppTrack dashboard

**Keep it simple:** Don't overdo graphics - your clean design is good. Just add visual proof that the product works and looks professional.

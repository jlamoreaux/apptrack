## Mobile-First Design Patterns Applied

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements: **44px minimum height** ✅
- Buttons use `min-h-11` class
- Inputs use `h-11 min-h-[44px]`
- Proper spacing between clickable elements

### Progressive Enhancement
```
Base (mobile) → sm (640px) → md (768px) → lg (1024px) → xl (1280px)
```

### Text Scaling Strategy
- Mobile: Base sizes (text-base, text-lg)
- Tablet: Medium sizes (sm:text-lg, sm:text-xl)
- Desktop: Large sizes (lg:text-xl, lg:text-2xl)

### Grid Layouts
- Mobile: 1-2 columns
- Tablet: 2-3 columns
- Desktop: 4-5 columns

---

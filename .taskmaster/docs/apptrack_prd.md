# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges

### AI Integration Complexity
**Risk**: AI features may be complex to implement and expensive to operate
**Mitigation**: 
- Start with simple AI integrations using established APIs (Replicate)
- Implement usage limits and caching to control costs
- Build AI features incrementally with user feedback
- Consider alternative AI providers for cost optimization

### Supabase Scaling Limitations
**Risk**: Supabase free tier limits may be exceeded as user base grows
**Mitigation**:
- Monitor usage closely and plan for Supabase Pro upgrade
- Implement efficient queries and proper indexing
- Use caching strategies to reduce database load
- Plan database optimization and query performance monitoring

## MVP Definition and Scope
**Current Status**: MVP is essentially complete, now in polish/optimization phase
**Risk**: Perfectionism may delay launch of already-functional product
**Mitigation**:
- Recognize that core functionality is already built and working
- Focus Phase 0 on user experience improvements rather than new features
- Set clear completion criteria for Phase 0 cleanup items
- Plan launch timeline based on polish completion rather than feature development
- Prioritize fixes that impact user adoption (navigation, accessibility, usability)

### Critical User Experience Issues (Phase 0)
**Risk**: Poor navigation and accessibility may prevent user adoption
**Mitigation**:
- Complete accessibility audit and fixes for WCAG AA compliance
- Implement intuitive navigation patterns (clickable cards, clear AI Coach access)
- Add essential dashboard functionality (pagination, sorting, filtering)
- Integrate AI features contextually with applications
- Test with real users to validate improvements

### Feature Completion Risk
**Risk**: Incomplete AI features (cover letter, career advice) may confuse users
**Mitigation**:
- Complete missing AI Coach features in Phase 0
- Ensure feature parity across AI Coach subscription tier
- Test complete AI workflow before launch
- Document any temporary limitations clearly

### Payment Integration Complexity
**Risk**: Stripe integration and subscription management may be complex
**Mitigation**:
- Use Stripe's well-documented APIs and webhooks
- Implement comprehensive testing for payment flows
- Build subscription management incrementally
- Have clear upgrade/downgrade user flows

## Resource Constraints

### Development Time Management
**Risk**: Solo development may lead to longer timelines
**Mitigation**:
- Break features into small, atomic development tasks
- Use existing UI component libraries (Radix) to speed development
- Leverage Supabase's built-in features (auth, real-time) rather than building from scratch
- Focus on core features first, defer nice-to-have features

### User Acquisition
**Risk**: Building a product without users to validate features
**Mitigation**:
- Launch MVP quickly to get user feedback
- Build features based on actual user needs rather than assumptions
- Create feedback loops and user testing processes
- Consider building audience before full product launch

## Business Model Risks

### Pricing Strategy Validation
**Risk**: Pricing may not align with user willingness to pay
**Mitigation**:
- Research competitor pricing thoroughly
- Implement usage analytics to understand value delivery
- Plan for pricing experiments and adjustments
- Offer generous free tier to encourage adoption

### AI Cost Management
**Risk**: AI features may have unpredictable costs that affect profitability
**Mitigation**:
- Set clear usage limits per subscription tier
- Implement cost monitoring and alerts
- Cache AI responses where appropriate
- Consider usage-based pricing for heavy AI users

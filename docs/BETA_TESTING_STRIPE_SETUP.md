- Conversion rate from beta to paid at end of trial
- Feature usage patterns and preferences

### 5. Production Deployment

#### Before Going Live:

   # Update .env with production keys
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
   ```

   - Test with a small group first

3. **Update pricing to production values:**

   - Ensure code applies to the correct price ID

2. **Webhook issues:**

   - Verify webhook secret matches environment variable
   - Monitor webhook logs in Stripe Dashboard

3. **Subscription not created:**
   - Check Stripe logs for failed payments
   - Verify customer creation is working
   - Check database user_subscriptions table

### 7. Cost Management

With GPT-4o-mini optimization, beta testing costs are minimal:
- **Previous cost**: $54/month per heavy AI user (unsustainable)
- **Optimized cost**: $2.52/month per heavy AI user (97% savings)
- **50 beta users**: ~$126/month total AI costs vs ~$2,700 previously

### 8. Beta Exit Strategy

   - Offer discounted pricing for early adopters
   - Provide conversion flow to paid subscription

2. **Graceful transition:**
   - Allow data export before losing access
   - Offer downgrade to Pro plan option
   - Collect final feedback survey

#### Success Metrics for Full Launch:
- 20%+ conversion rate from beta to paid
- 4.5+ star average user rating
- <5% of users report major bugs
- Positive unit economics with optimized AI costs

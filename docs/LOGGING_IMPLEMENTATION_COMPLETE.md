# Logging Implementation Complete

## Overview

Comprehensive logging has been successfully implemented across all layers of the AppTrack application following the audit guidelines. The implementation includes structured logging with Grafana/Loki integration, privacy protection, and performance optimization.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Logging Infrastructure ✅
- **Logger Service** (`/lib/services/logger.service.ts`): Singleton pattern with Winston and Loki transport
- **Type Definitions** (`/lib/services/logger.types.ts`): Comprehensive type safety
- **Configuration** (`/lib/services/logger.config.ts`): Centralized configuration
- **Utilities** (`/lib/services/logger.utils.ts`): Privacy and sanitization helpers
- **Middleware** (`/lib/middleware/logging.middleware.ts`): Request/response logging

### Layers Implemented ✅

#### 1. Authentication Middleware
- Permission checks with user plan tracking
- AI Coach access validation
- Rate limiting with usage tracking
- Authentication flow monitoring

#### 2. API Routes
- Authentication endpoints (check-session, profile, onboarding)
- AI Coach endpoints (resume analysis, job fit, etc.)
- Payment endpoints (checkout, webhooks)
- All routes include timing, error handling, and business metrics

#### 3. DAL/Database Layer  
- Applications DAL with query performance tracking
- All CRUD operations logged with timing
- Database error tracking and query metrics

#### 4. Services Layer
- AI Coach service with analysis tracking
- Subscription service with payment events
- Business metric logging for key events

#### 5. Authentication Flows
- Session management
- Profile updates
- Onboarding completion
- All auth events tracked with security context

#### 6. Payment Processing
- Stripe webhook handling
- Checkout session creation
- Subscription lifecycle events
- Payment success/failure tracking

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Privacy & Security**
- User ID hashing for correlation without exposing PII
- Email sanitization (shows only first few chars)
- URL parameter redaction for sensitive data
- No logging of passwords, tokens, or API keys

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- Log sampling in production
- Async operations to prevent blocking
- Performance threshold alerts
- Memory usage tracking

### 3. **Business Intelligence**
- Key metric tracking (subscriptions, payments, usage)
- User journey tracking through the application
- Error categorization and classification
- AI service cost estimation

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error capture and categorization
- Stack trace handling (development only)
- Silent failures in production
- Global error handlers (browser only)

### 5. **Structured Logging**
- Consistent log format across all layers
- Request ID propagation for tracing
- Category-based filtering
- Duration tracking for all operations

## Log Categories Used

- **AUTH**: Authentication and authorization events
- **API**: HTTP request/response logging
- **DATABASE**: Query execution and errors
- **PAYMENT**: Stripe and subscription events
- **AI_SERVICE**: AI coach operations
- **BUSINESS**: Key business metrics
- **SECURITY**: Security-related events
- **PERFORMANCE**: Slow operations
- **UI**: Client-side errors
- **EMAIL**: Email sending events

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables:
```bash
# Logging
LOG_SALT=<random-salt-for-user-id-hashing>
GRAFANA_LOKI_URL=<loki-endpoint-url>
LOG_LEVEL=info # or debug, warn, error
ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOGGING=true # for development
DISABLE_LOGGING=false # emergency kill switch
```

## Usage Examples

### API Route Logging
```typescript
loggerService.logApiRequest(
  request.method,
  request.url,
  response.status,
  duration,
  { userId, requestId }
);
```

### Database Operation Logging
```typescript
loggerService.logDatabaseQuery(
  'SELECT',
  'applications',
  duration,
  error,
  { userId, resultCount }
);
```

### Business Event Logging
```typescript
loggerService.logBusinessMetric(
  'subscription_created',
  1,
  'count',
  { userId, metadata: { planName } }
);
```

### AI Service Logging
```typescript
loggerService.logAiServiceCall(
  'ai_coach',
  'analyze_resume',
  duration,
  tokens,
  error,
  { userId }
);
```

## Monitoring & Alerting

With this implementation, you can now:

1. **Track User Journeys**: Follow users through authentication, feature usage, and payments
2. **Monitor Performance**: Identify slow queries, API calls, and AI operations
3. **Analyze Business Metrics**: Track conversions, feature adoption, and revenue
4. **Debug Issues**: Trace errors through the entire request lifecycle
5. **Ensure Security**: Monitor failed auth attempts and suspicious activities

## Next Steps

1. Configure Grafana dashboards for visualization
2. Set up alerts for critical errors and thresholds
3. Implement log retention policies
4. Create runbooks for common log patterns
5. Train team on using logs for debugging

The logging implementation is now complete and production-ready. All critical paths are instrumented, privacy is protected, and the system is prepared for comprehensive monitoring and debugging.

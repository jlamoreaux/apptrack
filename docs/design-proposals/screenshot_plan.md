## Pro Tips

1. **Consistent branding** - Use your app's actual colors/fonts
2. **Real UI elements** - Don't mock up fake interfaces
3. **Show state of completion** - Some applications should be "done"
4. **Hide sensitive info** - No real personal data, even in samples
5. **Mobile-first** - Many visitors browse on phones
6. **Loading states** - Show the app actually works, not just static mockups
